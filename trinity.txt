Arrow symbols are Unicode characters used to indicate direction, movement, or actions, and can be copied and pasted into text, documents, or digital interfaces.
Overview of Arrow Symbols
Arrow symbols visually point in a direction—left, right, up, down—or indicate actions such as returning, continuing, or moving forward. They are widely used in menus, instructions, lists, and messages to guide attention or show steps in a sequence. Arrows come in various styles, including plain, bold, curved, double, and bidirectional forms.

How to Use Arrow Symbols
Arrow symbols can be copied and pasted directly from websites or Unicode tables into documents, chats, or social media posts. Many platforms also support HTML codes and Alt codes for inserting arrows in web pages or software applications. For example, pressing ALT + 26 on a numeric keypad can produce a left arrow (←) in some systems.
